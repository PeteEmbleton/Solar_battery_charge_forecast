# Solar Forecast and Battery Control for Fronius Inverters

This Home Assistant add-on provides intelligent solar forecasting and automated battery charging control specifically designed for **Fronius inverters** with Modbus TCP capability.

## üéØ Overview

The add-on learns from your energy usage patterns and weather forecasts to automatically charge your battery from the grid during cheap power periods, ensuring you have sufficient stored energy when solar production is low.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Analyzes Historical Data** - Reviews your Home Assistant sensor history to understand power consumption patterns
2. **Forecasts Solar Production** - Uses Open-Meteo weather API to predict tomorrow's solar generation
3. **Predicts Power Needs** - Machine learning model predicts tomorrow's energy consumption
4. **Calculates Energy Deficit** - Determines if solar + current battery will meet tomorrow's needs
5. **Controls Fronius Inverter** - Automatically charges battery via Modbus TCP during configured cheap power windows
6. **Creates HA Sensors** - Auto-discovers and creates sensors in Home Assistant for monitoring and automation

## üîå Fronius Integration

- **Modbus TCP Control** - Direct communication with Fronius inverters
- **Charging Modes** - Switches between Normal Mode and External Charging
- **Rate Control** - Sets optimal charging rate based on remaining time in cheap power window
- **State Persistence** - Tracks charging state across add-on restarts to minimize unnecessary Modbus commands

## üè† Integration with Home Assistant

### Automatic Setup

**No manual configuration needed!** The add-on uses MQTT Discovery to automatically create all sensors when the container starts.

### Using the Sensors

Once running, you'll find all sensors under the **"Solar Forecast and Battery Control"** device in Home Assistant:

**Navigation:** Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí MQTT ‚Üí Solar Forecast and Battery Control

### Example Automations

```yaml
# Get notified when battery will charge tonight
automation:
  - alias: "Battery Charging Tonight Notification"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.solar_forecast_battery_will_charge_overnight
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "‚ö° Battery Charging Tonight"
          message: "Deficit: {{ states('sensor.solar_forecast_total_deficit') }} kWh"

  # Monitor when charging actually starts
  - alias: "Battery Charging Started"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.solar_forecast_currently_charging
        to: "on"

## üîß Fronius Setup Requirements

### Modbus TCP Configuration

1. **Enable Modbus TCP** on your Fronius inverter
2. **Set IP address** - Note your inverter's IP address
3. **Default port** - Usually 502 (standard Modbus port)
4. **Unit ID** - Typically 1 for Fronius inverters

### Required Fronius Registers

The add-on uses these Modbus registers:

- **40348** - Battery control mode (1=Normal, 3=External charge)
- **40356** - Charge rate setting (watts)

### Supported Fronius Models

Tested with Fronius inverters that support battery management. Most modern Fronius inverters with battery capability should work.
